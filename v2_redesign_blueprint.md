# Project Nexus: V2 Masterclass Redesign Blueprint

## Overview
Moving away from static brochure sites, we are treating these websites as **spatial, immersive experiences**. They are engineered to stop users in their tracks with technology, guide them flawlessly with UX, and convert them ruthlessly with strategy.

## The Unified Creative Direction: "The Nexus Experience"
*   **Vibe:** High-tech, tactile, frictionless, and unmistakably premium.
*   **Typography:** Sculptural, brutalist headings (`font-display`) paired with hyper-legible utility text (`font-sans`).
*   **Color Architecture:** 
    *   **Prime & AKF:** Dark mode by default (`slate-950`) to convey premium quality, pierced by intense neon accents (Electric Blue for Prime, Amber for AKF).
    *   **CleanJet:** The antithesis. Pristine, airy glassmorphism—frosty whites and soft teals to psychologically trigger the feeling of a spotless environment.

## 1. Prime Electrical — *The Energy Grid*
**The Vibe:** High-tech, futuristic, intelligent.
*   **Hero Concept:** A dark, subtle energy grid. As the user moves their cursor, electric currents pulse and follow the mouse. Massive gradient headline: **"Powering the Future of Auckland."** The CTA is a tactile selector where choosing a service (Solar, Heat Pumps) shifts the entire background ambient lighting.
*   **Navigation:** Transition to a floating "Island Navigation" dock at the bottom center.
*   **Creative Features:**
    *   **The "Light Switch" Toggle:** A physical-feeling UI switch to flip lighting modes.
    *   **Interactive Solar ROI Map:** An interactive visual where changing the "time of day" updates an estimated daily savings odometer.

## 2. AKF Construction — *The Architect's Canvas*
**The Vibe:** Brutalist, structural, masterful.
*   **Hero Concept:** Starts stark on a deep slate background. Heavy headline: **"We Build Legacies."** Scrolling triggers a visual assembly of a structural wireframe morphing into a photorealistic render.
*   **Navigation:** Vertical Kinetic Side-Nav that tracks progress via large transparent numbers.
*   **Creative Features:**
    *   **The Demolition Reveal:** A cursor-based interactive masking effect that "wipes away" an old room to reveal a new renovation.
    *   **Tactile Material UI:** Buttons and cards with simulated physical weight, 3D tilt, and concrete-like CSS textures on hover.

## 3. CleanJet — *The Pristine Reveal*
**The Vibe:** Breathable, flawless, frictionless.
*   **Hero Concept:** Loads with a frosted, "steamed glass" overlay. To enter, the user "wipes" the screen (via scroll or cursor), instantly dissolving the frost to reveal a hyper-crisp, blindingly sunlit living room. Headline: **"Auckland's 60-Second Clean."**
*   **Navigation:** Ultra-minimalist top sticky bar using pure CSS glassmorphism (`backdrop-blur-xl`).
*   **Creative Features:**
    *   **Liquid Booking Interface:** The pricing calculator is a natural-language sentence ("I need my [3] bedroom house cleaned..."). Changing a variable triggers a "water drop" ripple effect and updates the price.
    *   **"Dirt to Shine" Animation:** Service guarantees clean themselves on-scroll, transitioning from muted/dusty to brilliant white with a lens-flare effect.
