## Overview

Supporting Clean, Safe Learning Environments.

Clean learning spaces are essential for focus, wellbeing, and attendance. City Cleaning provides professional cleaning for schools and tertiary campuses across New Zealand — keeping classrooms, staff areas, and shared facilities healthy and hygienic.

Education environments need consistency, safety, and trust. Our teams work quietly behind the scenes so teachers can teach, students can learn, and parents can feel confident.
