## Overview

The Principles That Guide Everything We Do.

At City Cleaning, our values aren't just statements on a wall — they shape how we work, how we treat people, and how we make decisions. They reflect the diverse cultures, languages, and communities that make up our team.

## We Care

People, safety, and pride in every detail. We care for our people, our clients, and the communities we serve. Safety and wellbeing are at the core. We invest in our teams, value their contribution, and empower them with the right tools, support, and respect.

## We Listen

Respect builds understanding — and understanding builds trust. We listen to our staff, our clients, and our partners. Every voice matters. By taking time to understand people's needs, we strengthen relationships, anticipate challenges, and deliver solutions that make a real difference.

## We Deliver

Consistency, quality, and integrity in everything we do. We take pride in delivering on our word — every site, every shift, every day. Through strong leadership, skilled teams, and reliable systems, we achieve the highest standards of cleanliness and safety.

## We Belong

One team, united in respect and purpose. We succeed together. We value diversity, inclusion, and fairness. We're committed to creating a workplace where everyone feels safe, supported, and proud to belong.
