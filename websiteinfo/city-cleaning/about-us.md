## Overview

Cleaning New Zealand's Workplaces Since 1981.

For over 40 years, City Cleaning has helped workplaces across New Zealand stay clean, safe, and ready for business. From government buildings and universities to hospitals, offices, and retail spaces, we deliver consistent, high-quality cleaning backed by proven systems and genuine care.

We're proud to be one of New Zealand's largest locally owned commercial cleaning companies — not a franchise or overseas chain. Every decision is made here, by people who understand local communities and the standards New Zealand businesses expect.
