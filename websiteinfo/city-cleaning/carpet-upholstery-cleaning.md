## Overview

Deep Cleaning That Goes Beyond the Surface.

Carpets and soft furnishings collect dust, dirt, and allergens that regular vacuuming can't reach. City Cleaning's professional carpet and upholstery cleaning goes deep — lifting grime, bacteria, and odours from fibres to restore freshness and extend the life of your assets.

Hot-water extraction and low-moisture steam cleaning systems. Quick-dry options for high-use areas. Every clean includes stain identification and treatment.
