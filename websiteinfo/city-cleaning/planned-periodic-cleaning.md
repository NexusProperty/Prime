## Overview

The Cleaning Routine that keeps Standards High.

Keeping a busy workplace clean isn't a once-a-week job — it's an ongoing effort. Our daily and periodic cleaning programmes keep every part of your site looking sharp, hygienic, and ready for business.

**Daily cleaning:** desks, floors, bins, kitchens, washrooms, touch-points.  
**Periodic cleaning:** seasonal or quarterly deep cleans — carpets, windows, detailed wall washing, polishing, deep bathroom cleans.

## Consistent Quality, Continuous Improvement

Supervisors carry out regular inspections and digital audits. Live reports show what's been cleaned, when, and by whom. We regularly review and adjust your cleaning plan to stay aligned with how your site operates.
