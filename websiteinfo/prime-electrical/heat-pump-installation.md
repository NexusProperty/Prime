## Frequently Asked Questions

**H2:** Frequently Asked Questions — Heat Pump Installation Auckland

**Q: How do I choose the right heat pump for my Auckland home?**
When selecting a heat pump, key factors include room size, wall insulation, ceiling height, number of windows, local weather conditions, and where the unit can be placed. It is essential to size the equipment correctly for efficient heating and cooling. Prime Electrical's free consultation assesses all of these factors and recommends the right unit for your property.

**Q: How long does heat pump installation take with Prime Electrical?**
Most residential heat pump installations take half a day to a full working day, depending on the system type and installation complexity. Split system installs are typically faster, while ducted systems require more time. Prime Electrical provides a clear timeframe during your free consultation before any work begins.

**Q: How long does a heat pump last?**
A quality heat pump from brands like Mitsubishi, Daikin, or Panasonic typically lasts 15 to 20 years with regular servicing. Prime Electrical recommends annual maintenance to maximise your heat pump's lifespan and maintain efficient performance throughout Auckland's seasonal temperature changes.

**Q: How long is the warranty period on heat pumps installed by Prime Electrical?**
Warranty periods vary by brand, but most major brands installed by Prime Electrical — including Mitsubishi, Daikin, and Panasonic — offer manufacturer warranties of 5 years on parts and labour. Extended warranty options may be available. Ask your Prime Electrical technician during your consultation.

**Q: Do heat pumps produce noise?**
Modern heat pumps from Mitsubishi, Daikin, and Panasonic operate very quietly. Indoor units typically run at 19–30 decibels — quieter than a normal conversation. Outdoor units are slightly louder but are positioned and mounted to minimise noise disruption to your home and neighbours.

**Q: How frequently should I service my heat pump?**
Prime Electrical recommends servicing your heat pump at least once a year. Regular servicing maintains efficiency, extends the unit's lifespan, keeps filters clean (important for air quality), and ensures your warranty remains valid. Contact Prime Electrical on 09-390-3620 to arrange a service.

**Q: How much does a heat pump cost to run in Auckland?**
A heat pump typically costs $0.20–$0.40 per hour to operate in New Zealand, depending on unit size and your electricity tariff. Heat pumps are 3–5 times more energy-efficient than standard electric heaters, making them the most economical heating and cooling option for Auckland homes and businesses.

**Q: How do I apply for a heat pump subsidy in Auckland?**
EECA's Warmer Kiwi Homes programme offers eligible Auckland homeowners grants of up to 80% of the cost of heat pump installation. Eligibility typically depends on your home's insulation, income level, and location. Prime Electrical can guide you through the eligibility criteria and application process — call 09-390-3620 for details.
