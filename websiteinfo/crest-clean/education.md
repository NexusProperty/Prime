## CrestClean understands school cleaning

We have been a major provider of school cleaning services since 1996 and have over 700 customers, including primary, intermediate and secondary schools throughout New Zealand.

'Consistency' means a consistent level of cleaning, a consistent level of account management and term cleans performed consistently to the required standard on time.

Average staff turnover in the New Zealand cleaning industry ranges between 70% and 120% annually. For long-established institutions and schools that require reliable veteran staff, this raises issues with security and Health and Safety compliance.

We're known as New Zealand's best-educated school cleaners — all our personnel undertake formal training programmes including practical cleaning training, proficiency assessments and annual upskilling throughout their CrestClean careers. Our personnel are trained by The Master Cleaners Training Institute, a respected training organisation that has delivered internationally recognised programmes including courses accredited by the British Institute of Cleaning Science (BICSc).

At CrestClean, our average tenure is more than five years. More than 500 CrestClean cleaners have gained the BICSc Professional Skills Suite Certificate. Each year we host more than 200 training events for our personnel nationwide.

CrestClean is a Gold Business Partner to the New Zealand Principals' Federation and a partner since 2008.

## Employment Issues

Employing cleaners directly creates a management headache. CrestClean's cleaning services operate under a contract negotiated with the school. As part of our proposal and quotation we prepare a detailed specification of the duties to be performed. The contractual relationship allows the school to organise the cleaning programme in a businesslike manner, and maintain a fixed cost financial control.
