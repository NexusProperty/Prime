## Overview

You love retail, we love to clean. Showtime. That's for you… and for CrestClean.

We understand you want the cleanest windows, shiniest floors and sparkling clean surfaces to showcase your products.

When your customers are impressed, and you're happy, then we're happy too.

Presentation is everything in a retail or high foot traffic environment. Gleaming windows, shining floors and beautifully presented product are all part of attracting people into your space.

Customers walk in with dirt and debris off the street – they also bring coughs, colds and the flu, potentially contaminating your environment. Cross-contamination is now recognised as a leading cause of workplace sickness. The solution? A specialised cleaning system that not only enhances presentation, but also sanitises workplaces and improves overall hygiene.
