## Overview

Protect your workplace against the flu and other viruses with CrestClean's Commercial Sanitising Service. We sanitise surfaces that people touch often using our EPA rated Anti-Viral Sanitiser.

Cold or flu germs can live for a long time (up to 48 hours) on surfaces like doorknobs and objects people touch with their hands. It is important to take precautions to prevent employees from contracting and spreading any viruses or influenza.

## Sanitising Touch Surfaces

Viruses, including Coronavirus and Influenza are killed by the correct application of an effective sanitiser. CrestClean recommends sanitising surfaces that people frequently touch with Anti-Viral Sanitiser regularly.

For high touch areas we can provide a Sanitising Service using Anti-Viral Sanitiser. The sanitiser has a residual effect – traces of sanitiser left on the surface will keep on killing any new pathogens that may land on the surface. The surfaces need to be cleaned to remove biofilm build-up, then manually wiped with the Anti-Viral Sanitiser.

CrestClean personnel apply Anti-Viral Sanitiser to specific surfaces that people touch, i.e. door knobs, door push plates, kitchen areas, taps, microwave ovens, fridge doors, toilet buttons, soap dispensers, hand dryers etc.

The service is carried out at agreed periods, i.e. daily, 3 x weekly, or weekly in addition to regular contract cleaning.

A schedule of the surfaces to be sanitised will be prepared and a quotation provided.
