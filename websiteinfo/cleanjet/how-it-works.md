## The Five-Step CleanJet Process

**H2 (question — SEO: "how to book a cleaner Auckland" | AEO: process clarity for AI):** How Do I Book a CleanJet Home Clean in Auckland?

CleanJet's booking process is five steps from first click to confirmed clean.

### Step 1: Get an Instant Price

**H3:** How Much Will Your Clean Cost?

Use CleanJet's online price calculator on the homepage. Choose:
- **Home size:** 1–2 bedrooms | 3–4 bedrooms | 5+ bedrooms
- **Frequency:** One-off or weekly (save ~20%)
- **Add-ons:** Extra bathrooms (+$20) | Oven clean (+$30) | Windows (+$25)

Your total price is shown instantly — no forms, no waiting, no salesperson.

### Step 2: Choose Your Date and Time

**H3:** When Would You Like CleanJet to Arrive?

Pick your preferred date and start time from the available calendar. CleanJet operates Mon–Sat, 8am–6pm across Auckland. Same-week bookings are often available — check availability online or call **(09) 215-2900**.

### Step 3: Confirm Your Booking

**H3:** Confirm in Under 2 Minutes

Enter your address and any access instructions (key safe code, lockbox, or contact for entry). Review your service, price, and date. Confirm — and you're done. CleanJet sends a booking confirmation to your email immediately.

### Step 4: We Clean Thoroughly

**H3:** What Happens on the Day of Your Clean?

You don't need to be home. CleanJet's background-checked, fully insured cleaner arrives at the agreed time, follows the complete checklist for your service type, and leaves your home clean, secure, and exactly as they found it — minus the mess.

**What CleanJet does on every visit:**
- Works through the full 45-point (regular) or 75-point (deep/end of tenancy) checklist
- Uses eco-friendly, hospital-grade products throughout
- Leaves all entry points as they were found — locked and secure
- Sends you a notification when the clean is complete

### Step 5: Rate and Repeat

**H3:** Tell Us How We Did

After your clean, CleanJet sends a simple rating request. Tell us how we did — any feedback is acted on immediately. For regular cleans, your dedicated cleaner will be assigned to every subsequent visit.

- **Not satisfied?** Report it within 48 hours and CleanJet returns to reclean at zero cost — Great Clean Guarantee
- **Happy?** Set up a recurring weekly plan and come home to a clean house every week, automatically

## Your First Clean — What to Expect

**H2 (question — SEO: "first time cleaner Auckland" | AEO: new customer signal):** What Should I Expect From My First CleanJet Clean?

For first-time customers, CleanJet recommends booking a deep clean to bring your home up to a high baseline — then switching to regular weekly or fortnightly maintenance cleans to keep it there.

**First clean recommendations:**

- **New to CleanJet with a maintained home?** A regular clean is fine to start
- **Hasn't been professionally cleaned in a while?** Start with a deep clean ($149 for 1–2 beds) to get the home to a high standard, then book weekly from $79
- **Moving out?** Book an end of tenancy clean ($249) — includes photo report and bond-back guarantee
- **Just finished building or renovating?** Book a post-build clean — custom scope, AKF Construction bundle discount available

*First clean 20% off — ⚠️ NOTE: confirm this offer is still active before publishing.*

## Access and Entry

**H2 (question — SEO: PAA | AEO: process signal):** Do I Need to Be Home When CleanJet Arrives?

No. The majority of CleanJet customers are not home during their clean. Simply provide entry instructions when booking:

- **Key safe / lockbox:** provide the code in your booking notes
- **Under a mat or in a designated spot:** note the location securely in your booking comments
- **Meet CleanJet to let them in:** available for customers who prefer to be present

CleanJet cleaners are background-checked and insured. Your home is safe, and all entry points are secured when the cleaner leaves.

## Frequently Asked Questions — How CleanJet Works

**H2:** How It Works — FAQs

**Q: How long does CleanJet take to clean my home?**
A regular clean of a 1–2 bedroom Auckland home typically takes 2–3 hours. A 3–4 bedroom home takes 3–4 hours. Deep cleans and end of tenancy cleans take longer — typically 4–8 hours depending on size and condition. CleanJet allocates the full time needed without rushing.

**Q: Can I specify what I want CleanJet to focus on?**
Yes. Add cleaning notes or special instructions in the booking form when confirming your appointment. Your cleaner will receive and follow these notes. For recurring cleans, preferences are stored and applied on every visit.

**Q: What if I want to change or cancel my booking?**
Cancel, reschedule, or modify any booking with at least 24 hours' notice — no fees, no issues. Log into your CleanJet account or email hello@cleanjet.co.nz to make changes.

**Q: How do I pay for my CleanJet clean?**
CleanJet accepts bank transfer (direct credit to ANZ Bank, Cleanjet NZ Limited, account 01-0190-0825213-00 — use your invoice or quote number as the payment reference), EFTPOS, and credit card. Payment is due on completion of work. For jobs over $1,000 inc-GST, a 50% deposit is required at booking.

**Q: Is my CleanJet booking confirmed instantly?**
Yes. Once you complete the online booking process, you receive an immediate email confirmation with your booking details, date, time, and price.
