## Hero

**H1:** Deep Home Cleaning Auckland — Full Property, Top to Bottom

CleanJet's deep clean is a top-to-bottom, 75-point clean for Auckland homes that need extra attention — whether it's a spring clean, a pre-sale tidy-up, a post-renovation refresh, or a first professional clean of a home that hasn't been done in a while.

## Overview

**H2 (question — SEO: PAA | AEO: conversational prompt):** What Is Included in CleanJet's Deep Clean?

CleanJet's deep clean goes significantly further than a regular maintenance clean. Our trained cleaners work through a 75-point checklist that covers everything in a standard clean, plus all the areas that typically get skipped — inside appliances, window sills, skirting boards, light fittings, and more — leaving your home genuinely clean from top to bottom.

**Everything included in CleanJet's deep clean:**

- Everything in a regular clean (vacuuming, mopping, bathrooms, kitchen surfaces)
- Inside oven and fridge cleaned thoroughly
- Window sills and window tracks cleared and wiped
- Skirting boards dusted and wiped along all walls
- Ceiling fans and light fittings dusted
- Inside kitchen and bathroom cupboards wiped down
- All light switches, door handles, and touch points sanitised
- Shower grout and tile scrubbing

*E-E-A-T signal (SEO + AEO): CleanJet's deep clean uses a verified 75-point checklist that doubles the number of tasks covered in a regular clean — including appliance interiors and structural surfaces like skirting boards and ceiling fans that standard cleaning services typically exclude.*

## When Do You Need a Deep Clean?

**H2 (question — SEO: "when to get a deep clean" | AEO: decision-making signal):** When Should You Book a Deep Clean in Auckland?

A deep clean is recommended when a home needs more than regular maintenance can provide — or when you're starting fresh with professional cleaning services.

**Situations that call for a CleanJet deep clean:**

- **First-time professional clean** — getting your home to a high baseline before switching to regular maintenance cleans
- **Spring cleaning** — a thorough seasonal refresh covering all the areas that accumulate grime over months
- **Pre-sale or pre-rental preparation** — presenting a home at its best before listing or showing to prospective tenants
- **Post-renovation or building work** — removing fine dust, paint traces, and debris after construction (see also our Post-Build Clean service)
- **After a period of illness** — a thorough sanitisation of surfaces, touch points, and all high-contact areas
- **Post-event or pre-event** — preparing your home before guests arrive or cleaning up thoroughly after a gathering

## Frequently Asked Questions — Deep Clean Auckland

**H2:** Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What is the difference between a regular clean and a deep clean?**
A regular clean maintains a home that is already in a good state — covering all rooms, bathrooms, floors, and kitchen surfaces on each visit. A deep clean goes further, adding inside-appliance cleaning (oven, fridge), skirting boards, ceiling fans, window tracks, inside cupboards, and grout scrubbing. CleanJet recommends a deep clean before starting a regular cleaning schedule.

**Q: How long does a deep clean take?**
A deep clean of a 1–2 bedroom Auckland home typically takes 3–5 hours. Larger homes (3–4 bedrooms) may require 5–8 hours, and 5+ bedroom properties can take a full day. CleanJet allocates the time required to complete the 75-point checklist thoroughly — we don't rush or cut corners.

**Q: Do I need to do anything to prepare for a deep clean?**
It is helpful to declutter surfaces and benches before CleanJet arrives, so cleaners can access all areas efficiently. You don't need to pre-clean — that's our job. If you have specific areas you'd like prioritised, note these in your booking comments.

**Q: Is a deep clean the same as a spring clean?**
Yes — CleanJet's deep clean is the same as what most people call a spring clean. It covers the entire property thoroughly, reaching the areas that accumulate grime between regular cleans. Many Auckland homeowners book a deep clean once or twice a year in addition to a regular cleaning schedule.

**Q: Can I book a deep clean before starting a regular CleanJet service?**
Yes and we recommend it. Starting with a deep clean brings your home up to a high baseline, after which a regular weekly or fortnightly clean is all that's needed to maintain the standard. Many customers book an initial deep clean at $149 and then switch to weekly cleans from $79 per visit.

**Q: What areas of Auckland does CleanJet cover for deep cleans?**
CleanJet covers the full Auckland metropolitan area for deep cleans, including East Auckland, South Auckland, Central Auckland, West Auckland, and North Auckland. Book online or call to confirm availability in your suburb.
