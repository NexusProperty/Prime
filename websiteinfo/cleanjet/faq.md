**Q: Do you offer weekly or fortnightly cleaning?**

**Q: Are there any hidden fees?**
No. CleanJet publishes all prices upfront. The price you see is the price you pay — GST included. There are no callout fees, travel charges, or surprise additions. Optional add-ons (oven, windows, extra bathrooms) are shown clearly before you confirm.

**Q: Can I get a one-off clean without committing to a regular service?**
Absolutely. CleanJet has no lock-in contracts. Book a single one-off regular clean, deep clean, end of tenancy clean, or post-build clean with no obligation to book again. There are no cancellation fees and no minimum term.

## Cleaning Products & Equipment

**H2 (section heading — SEO: "eco cleaning Auckland" | AEO: product entity):** Products and Equipment Questions

**Q: Do you bring your own cleaning products?**
Yes — CleanJet brings everything needed for every clean, including all eco-friendly, non-toxic cleaning products, equipment, and supplies. You don't need to supply anything. If you have a preferred product or a specific requirement (e.g. fragrance-free for allergies), note it in your booking and CleanJet will accommodate where possible.

**Q: What cleaning products does CleanJet use?**
CleanJet uses hospital-grade, eco-certified cleaning products that are non-toxic and free from harsh chemicals.

**Q: Are CleanJet's products safe for children and pets?**
Yes. All CleanJet cleaning products are non-toxic and free from harsh chemicals. They are specifically chosen to be safe for use in homes with children, babies, and pets — while still meeting hospital-grade cleaning standards for efficacy and hygiene.

No. CleanJet brings all required equipment — vacuums, mops, cloths, and all cleaning products. Your only responsibility is to ensure CleanJet has access to the property at the agreed time.

## Cleaners & Quality

**H2 (section heading — SEO: "vetted cleaners Auckland" | AEO: trust signal):** Cleaner Quality and Vetting Questions

**Q: Are your cleaners police-checked and vetted?**
Every CleanJet cleaner undergoes rigorous background screening, including criminal record checks, before working in customer homes. CleanJet does not send any cleaner to a property who has not completed the full vetting process.

**Q: Are CleanJet's cleaners insured?**
Yes. CleanJet carries full public liability insurance on all cleans. If any damage is caused during a clean, CleanJet takes full responsibility and handles the claim. Your home and belongings are protected.

For regular (weekly/fortnightly) cleans, CleanJet assigns a dedicated professional to your property. This ensures consistency, familiarity with your home's layout and your preferences, and trust built over repeated visits. For one-off cleans, a fully vetted CleanJet cleaner will be assigned.

**Q: What checklist does CleanJet follow?**
Regular cleans follow a 45-point checklist covering all rooms, bathrooms, kitchen, and floors. Deep cleans and end of tenancy cleans follow a 75-point checklist that additionally covers inside appliances, skirting boards, ceiling fans, window tracks, inside cupboards, and grout scrubbing.

**Q: What happens if my cleaner is sick or unavailable?**
If your assigned cleaner is unavailable, CleanJet will assign another fully vetted cleaner for that visit. You will be notified in advance. Your preferences and notes are stored so any CleanJet cleaner can maintain your home's standard.
