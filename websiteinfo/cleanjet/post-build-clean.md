## Frequently Asked Questions — Post-Build Cleaning Auckland

**H2:** Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What is post-build cleaning and why do I need it?**
Post-build cleaning is a specialist clean carried out after construction or renovation work is completed. Building work generates fine dust that spreads through an entire property, plus paint splashes, adhesive residue, and debris that standard cleaning products cannot easily remove. A professional post-build clean ensures your home is safe, hygienic, and ready to live in after the builders leave.

**Q: How long does a post-build clean take?**
Post-build cleaning timescales vary significantly depending on the scope of the renovation, the size of the property, and the amount of dust and debris involved. A single-room renovation might take 2–4 hours; a full-property renovation could require a full day or more. CleanJet assesses each project individually and provides a time estimate with your quote.

**Q: Can CleanJet clean a property while building work is still in progress?**
CleanJet generally works best when construction is fully completed — or at a specific stage where a section of the property is finished and ready. We can discuss phased cleans for larger projects where sections are completed at different times. Contact CleanJet to discuss the timing of your build.

**Q: What types of renovation projects does CleanJet handle post-build cleaning for?**
CleanJet handles post-build cleans following all types of residential renovation in Auckland, including: deck construction, fence installation, new kitchens and bathrooms, full home renovations, new home builds, loft conversions, extensions, and cosmetic renovation work (painting, flooring, plastering).

**Q: Does CleanJet work with builders and project managers directly?**
Yes. CleanJet coordinates directly with builders, project managers, and property developers for post-build cleaning across Auckland. As the official cleaning partner of AKF Construction, we have experience working within construction project timelines and handover processes.

**Q: How do I get the AKF Construction bundle discount?**
If you are an AKF Construction client, mention your project when booking CleanJet online or ask your AKF project manager to coordinate the clean directly with CleanJet. The bundle discount is applied automatically for confirmed AKF Construction projects.
