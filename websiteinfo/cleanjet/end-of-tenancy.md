## Frequently Asked Questions — End of Tenancy Cleaning Auckland

**H2:** Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What is end of tenancy cleaning in New Zealand?**
End of tenancy cleaning (also called a bond clean or move-out clean) is a thorough, professional clean of a rental property when a tenant is vacating. In New Zealand, landlords can withhold part of a bond if the property is not returned in the same condition as at the start of the tenancy. A professional end of tenancy clean helps ensure tenants receive their full bond back.

**Q: Does CleanJet's end of tenancy clean include carpet steam cleaning?**
Carpet steam cleaning is available as an add-on to CleanJet's end of tenancy service. It is one of the most common reasons bonds are withheld in New Zealand, so we recommend adding it if your property has carpeted rooms. Contact CleanJet when booking to include carpet steam cleaning and receive a combined price.

**Q: How long does an end of tenancy clean take?**
An end of tenancy clean typically takes 4–8 hours depending on the size and condition of the property. CleanJet allocates sufficient time to complete the full 75-point checklist thoroughly — we do not rush. For larger or heavily soiled properties, a second day may occasionally be required.

**Q: Do I need to be present during the end of tenancy clean?**
You don't need to be present during the clean. Many tenants have already vacated by the time the clean takes place. Simply arrange key access with CleanJet and we'll complete the clean and provide a photo report on the same day.

**Q: What if my property manager isn't satisfied with the clean?**
CleanJet's bond-back guarantee means if your property manager or landlord is not satisfied with the standard of any area of the clean, we will return to reclean those specific areas at no additional cost. Simply contact us within 48 hours of the clean with details of the concern.

**Q: Does CleanJet work with property managers directly?**
Yes. CleanJet works directly with Auckland property managers and landlords for end of tenancy cleans and regular property turnaround cleaning between tenancies. Contact hello@cleanjet.co.nz to discuss a regular arrangement for your managed properties.

**Q: Can CleanJet do a last-minute or same-day end of tenancy clean?**
CleanJet has availability Mon–Sat 8am–6pm. For urgent bookings, call **(09) 215-2900** to check same-day or next-day availability. We recommend booking at least 48 hours in advance where possible to guarantee your preferred date.
