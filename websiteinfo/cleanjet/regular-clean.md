## Frequently Asked Questions — Regular Clean

**H2:** Frequently Asked Questions About CleanJet's Regular Clean

**Q: How often should I get my home cleaned professionally?**
Most Auckland homeowners opt for a weekly or fortnightly regular clean — weekly if you have children or pets, or a busy household. A fortnightly clean suits smaller homes or those who do light maintenance between visits. CleanJet's weekly plan saves you ~20% compared to individual one-off bookings.

**Q: Do I need to be home when the cleaner arrives?**
No. You don't need to be home. Simply leave entry instructions when you book — a key code, key location, or access code — and CleanJet's cleaner will let themselves in, complete the clean, and secure your home on leaving.

**Q: Will I get the same cleaner every time?**
Yes. CleanJet assigns a dedicated professional to your property for regular cleans. This ensures consistency, familiarity with your home's layout and preferences, and a built-in level of trust across every visit.

**Q: What cleaning products does CleanJet use?**
CleanJet uses hospital-grade, eco-certified cleaning products that are non-toxic and free from harsh chemicals. They are safe for children, pets, and the environment while delivering a thorough, hygienic clean. You don't need to supply anything — we bring everything.

**Q: Can I add extra services to my regular clean?**
Yes. You can add an oven clean (+$30), window cleaning (+$25), or extra bathrooms (+$20) to any regular clean. Simply select add-ons when booking online or let us know when confirming your appointment.

**Q: What happens if I'm not happy with the clean?**
CleanJet's 100% satisfaction guarantee means if any area doesn't meet our standard, notify us within 48 hours and we'll return to reclean the affected areas at no cost. No questions asked.
