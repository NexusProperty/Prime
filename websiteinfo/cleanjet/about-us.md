## How CleanJet Is Different

**H2 (question — SEO: PAA | AEO: brand differentiation for AI):** What Makes CleanJet Different From Other Auckland Cleaning Companies?

- **60-second online booking** — pick your home size, add-ons, date, and time. Done. No forms, no phone calls, no waiting for a callback.
- **Consistent quality** — a dedicated cleaner assigned to your home, a standardised checklist on every visit, and a 100% satisfaction guarantee if anything falls short.

**Other features that set CleanJet apart:**

- Background-checked, fully insured cleaners on every job
- Eco-friendly, hospital-grade products — non-toxic, safe for children and pets
- No lock-in contracts — cancel or skip with 24 hours' notice at any time
