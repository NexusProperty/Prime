## Why CleanJet Publishes Its Prices

**H2 (question — SEO: "how much does a cleaner cost Auckland" | AEO: direct price answer for AI):** Why Doesn't CleanJet Ask You to Request a Quote?

Most Auckland cleaning companies ask you to fill in a form, wait 24–48 hours, and then receive a quote that may or may not match your budget. CleanJet believes you deserve to know the price before you book. All CleanJet prices are calculated on a transparent per-service formula: property size + service type + any add-ons you choose.

**What every CleanJet price includes:**
- All cleaning products and equipment
- A background-checked, insured cleaner (covered by $5,000,000 public liability insurance)
- A standardised checklist for your service type
- 100% satisfaction guarantee — reclean within 48 hours if not satisfied
- GST included in every price on this page

## Pricing FAQ

**H2:** Pricing Questions Answered

**Q: Are CleanJet's prices GST-inclusive?**
Yes. All CleanJet prices on this page are GST-inclusive (CleanJet GST registration number: 144-124-286). There are no hidden fees, callout charges, or travel costs added at billing.

**Q: Why is the oven clean $90 standalone but $30 as a website add-on?**
The $30 oven clean shown in the website booking calculator is an add-on to a regular maintenance clean. The $90 flat fee is the standalone oven clean service — scoped and invoiced separately as a dedicated job. When added to a regular clean, the oven is cleaned as part of the overall visit at a lower incremental cost.

**Q: How does carpet shampoo pricing work?**
Carpet shampoo is charged at $9 per square metre inc-GST, with a minimum charge of approximately $92 inc-GST. For an average bedroom (15–20 m²), carpet shampoo costs approximately $135–$180 inc-GST. Whole-house carpet cleans are quoted individually.

**Q: Do prices vary by Auckland suburb?**
No. CleanJet charges the same prices across all Auckland suburbs — there are no travel or distance surcharges within the Auckland metropolitan area.

**Q: What is CleanJet's cancellation fee?**
Cancellations made with less than 24 hours' notice may incur a cancellation fee of up to 50% of the quoted service cost. Cancellations made with more than 24 hours' notice incur no fee.

**Q: Is a deposit required?**
For jobs valued at more than $1,000 inc-GST, CleanJet may require a 50% deposit upon booking. Smaller jobs are payable on completion.
