## What Is the Great Clean Guarantee?

**H2 (question — SEO: brand trust | AEO: guarantee entity for AI):** What Does CleanJet's Great Clean Guarantee Cover?

CleanJet's Great Clean Guarantee is a simple, unconditional promise: every clean you book with CleanJet meets our professional cleaning standard. If it doesn't — for any reason — we fix it immediately at no cost to you.

**The guarantee covers:**

- **Any area not cleaned to standard** — if we miss a spot, surface, appliance, or room on your checklist, we return and complete it
- **Any area cleaned below our standard** — if a bathroom, kitchen, or floor doesn't meet our quality bar, we reclean it to the correct standard
- **End of tenancy** — if your bond is withheld due to cleaning, we return and reclean the specific area(s) cited by your property manager, at no cost
- **Any clean, any service type** — the guarantee applies to regular cleans, deep cleans, end of tenancy cleans, and post-build cleans

**What the guarantee does not cover:**

- Damage caused by factors outside CleanJet's control (e.g. pre-existing damage, structural issues)
- Areas not included in your booked service type (e.g. oven interior if the oven add-on was not selected)
- Claims made more than 48 hours after the clean was completed

*E-E-A-T signal (SEO + AEO): CleanJet's Great Clean Guarantee is an explicit, unconditional service guarantee — not a vague satisfaction policy. CleanJet dispatches a team to physically reclean any unsatisfactory area within 48 hours of notification, at zero cost.*

## How to Claim the Guarantee

**H2 (question — SEO: PAA | AEO: process clarity):** How Do I Claim CleanJet's Great Clean Guarantee?

The process is simple and hassle-free.

1. **Contact CleanJet within 48 hours** of your clean — by email (hello@cleanjet.co.nz) or phone **(09) 215-2900**
2. **Describe the issue** — tell us which area or areas didn't meet the standard. Photos are helpful but not required.
3. **CleanJet schedules the reclean** — we will arrange a return visit within 48 hours at a time that suits you
4. **We come back and fix it** — a CleanJet cleaner returns and recleans the affected areas to the correct standard, at zero cost

That's it. No forms to complete, no claims process, no disputes. Just a clean home.

## Bond-Back Guarantee (End of Tenancy)

**H2 (question — SEO: "bond back guarantee NZ" | AEO: specific guarantee entity):** Does CleanJet Guarantee Bond Return for End of Tenancy Cleans?

Yes. CleanJet's end of tenancy clean includes a specific bond-back guarantee in addition to the standard Great Clean Guarantee.

**How the bond-back guarantee works:**

- CleanJet completes your end of tenancy clean and provides a photo report of the finished property
- If your landlord or property manager withholds any portion of your bond due to cleaning, you contact CleanJet with the specific areas cited
- CleanJet returns and recleans those areas at zero cost — immediately
- You use the reclean and updated photo evidence to support your bond return claim

*The bond-back guarantee applies only to areas covered by the 75-point end of tenancy checklist. It does not cover damage, pre-existing condition issues, or non-cleaning disputes.*

## Why CleanJet Can Offer This Guarantee

**H2 (question — SEO: E-E-A-T signal | AEO: credibility justification):** Why Is CleanJet Confident Enough to Guarantee Every Clean?

CleanJet is able to offer an unconditional guarantee because of the systems in place behind every clean:

- **Standardised checklists** — 45-point (regular) and 75-point (deep and end of tenancy) checklists leave no room for guesswork on what needs to be done
- **Vetted, trained professionals** — every cleaner is background-checked and trained in CleanJet's cleaning standards before entering a customer's home
- **$5,000,000 public liability insurance** — Cleanjet NZ Limited (GST 144-124-286) carries $5M insurance on every job, giving customers additional protection beyond the guarantee itself
- **Consistent assigned cleaners** — regular customers receive the same dedicated cleaner, who learns the specific needs and standards of your home over time
- **Eco-sterile products** — hospital-grade, eco-certified products ensure effective cleaning on the first visit, not just superficial surface treatment

## Frequently Asked Questions — Great Clean Guarantee

**H2:** Guarantee FAQs

**Q: What counts as not meeting CleanJet's standard?**
Any area listed on your service checklist that was not cleaned, was cleaned below a hygienic standard, or was missed entirely is covered by the guarantee. Examples include: a bathroom not properly scrubbed, floors still showing visible grime after mopping, inside appliances not cleaned when the add-on was selected, or a room that appears not to have been cleaned.

**Q: Do I need photos to claim the guarantee?**
No. Photos are helpful as supporting documentation (especially for end of tenancy bond disputes), but they are not required to claim the Great Clean Guarantee. Simply contact CleanJet and describe the issue.

**Q: Is there a limit to how many times I can claim the guarantee?**
There is no limit. CleanJet's standard is perfection on every visit. If any visit falls short, the guarantee applies — regardless of how many times you may need to use it.

**Q: Does the guarantee apply to post-build cleans?**
Yes. The Great Clean Guarantee applies to all CleanJet service types, including post-build cleans. If any area of a post-build clean doesn't meet our standard, CleanJet returns and completes it at zero cost.
