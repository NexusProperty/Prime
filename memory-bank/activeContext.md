## Current Focus
VAN initialization — establishing project context for the United Trades ecosystem build.

Next immediate action: Begin PHASE1-001 (Prime Electrical code fixes) or run `/plan` to start detailed planning for Phase 1.

## Recent Completions
- SETUP-001: Full Cursor AI environment configured (.cursor/agents, commands, rules, skills, memory-bank/, Maunal/, AGENTS.md, .cursorrules)

## Active Tasks
- INIT-001: Project initialization & Memory Bank setup (In Progress)

## Backlog (Priority Order)
1. PHASE1-001 — Prime Electrical: Fix stats counter (hardcode "10+ Years"), fix typos ("Competent", "Recommend"), auto-format prices
2. PHASE1-002 — Prime Electrical: Add mobile sticky footer (Call Now / Book Online buttons)
3. PHASE1-003 — Prime Electrical: Set up missed call text-back via Twilio/Make.com
4. PHASE2-001 — Supabase staging database schema (leads table, cross-tag linking)
5. PHASE2-002 through PHASE2-005 — New site builds + AI training

## Open Questions
- Which job management software is confirmed? (Simpro vs Fergus vs Tradify)
- Are the 3 Twilio phone numbers already purchased?
- Does Prime Electrical have an existing codebase to migrate, or start fresh on Salient?
- Is Vapi.ai account already set up?
- Should AKF and CleanJet share one Supabase project or separate?
