# CleanJet — Knowledge Base FAQ

## Services

### What cleaning services do you offer?
CleanJet offers residential cleaning, commercial office cleaning, post-renovation and builder's cleans, end-of-tenancy cleans, spring cleans, and regular maintenance cleaning on a weekly, fortnightly, or monthly subscription basis.

### What is included in a standard residential clean?
A standard residential clean includes: vacuuming and mopping all floors, cleaning bathrooms (toilet, shower, basin, mirror), cleaning the kitchen (benches, sink, exterior of appliances, stovetop), dusting surfaces and window sills, and removing rubbish. Deep cleans and oven cleans are available as add-ons.

### Do you do post-renovation cleans?
Yes. This is one of our specialties — especially for projects completed by AKF Construction. Post-build cleans include removing all builder's dust, cleaning new surfaces, windows, and fixtures, and leaving the property ready to move into. Post-renovation cleans start from $199.

### Do you clean commercial spaces?
Yes. We clean offices, retail spaces, medical clinics, and light industrial premises. Commercial cleaning is priced per visit depending on size. A standard small office (under 150sqm) starts from $149 per visit.

## Pricing

### How much does a residential clean cost?
One-bedroom property: from $99. Two-bedroom: from $139. Three-bedroom: from $179. Four-bedroom: from $219. Prices include all eco-friendly cleaning products and equipment. GST included.

### Do you offer subscription pricing?
Yes. A weekly cleaning subscription saves you 20% off the standard price. Fortnightly saves 10%. Subscriptions can be paused or cancelled with 7 days notice.

### Is there a minimum booking?
Our minimum booking is a two-hour clean. Most standard residential cleans take 2 to 4 hours depending on property size.

## Products

### What cleaning products do you use?
We use eco-friendly, low-toxin cleaning products that are safe for children and pets. Our products are biodegradable and New Zealand-made where possible. We can accommodate requests for fragrance-free products.

## Partner Services

### Do you work with builders?
Yes. We have a preferred partnership with AKF Construction and regularly provide post-build cleans as part of their project handover. If you have just completed a renovation, we can have your home spotless and move-in ready.

We recommend The Prime Electrical for any electrical inspection or upgrade work. If you notice any electrical concerns during a clean, we will flag it for you.
