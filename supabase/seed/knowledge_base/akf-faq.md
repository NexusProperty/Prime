### Do you handle full home renovations?
Yes. We manage full home renovations from initial concept through to completion. Our project timeline follows four stages: Consultation → Design → Build → Handover (which includes a CleanJet post-build clean for a pristine finish).

### Can you build a kitchen?
Yes. Kitchen renovations are one of our specialties. A standard kitchen renovation typically takes 3 to 5 weeks and starts from $25,000 depending on size, materials, and appliance selection. We work with leading NZ kitchen suppliers.

### Can you build a deck?
Yes. Timber and composite decks are common projects. A standard 20sqm treated pine deck typically starts from $8,000 including posts, framing, decking boards, and balustrade. Composite and hardwood options are available at a premium.

### Do you handle bathroom renovations?
Yes. Bathroom renovations typically take 2 to 4 weeks. A standard bathroom renovation starts from $15,000. This includes new shower, vanity, toilet, tiling, and fixtures. Ensuite and wet room configurations available.

## Process

### How does a project work?
1. Free consultation: we visit your property and discuss your vision and budget.
2. Design and quote: we prepare detailed plans and a fixed-price quote.
3. Build: our team manages the full build with regular progress updates.
4. Handover: the job is inspected and signed off to your satisfaction.

### Do you need council consent?
Many projects require building consent from your local council. We manage the consent process for you where required. We advise on consent requirements during the consultation stage.

## Timeline

### How long do projects take?
Small projects (decks, bathrooms): 2 to 5 weeks. Medium projects (kitchens, extensions): 6 to 12 weeks. Full renovations: 12 to 24 weeks. Timelines depend on consent, materials, and scope. We provide a detailed schedule at quote stage.

## Warranty

### Do you offer a warranty?
Yes. We provide a 12-month workmanship warranty on all our work. Many products and materials carry their own manufacturer warranties. New residential builds have a 10-year building warranty under the Building Act.

## Electrical and Cleaning Partners

### Do you handle the electrical work?
We partner with The Prime Electrical for all electrical rough-in and final fix work within our projects. This means you get one coordinated team managing the full project.

### What about cleaning after a build?
We partner with CleanJet to provide a professional post-build clean as part of our handover package. This leaves your property move-in ready with no builder's dust or debris.
