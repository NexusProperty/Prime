> "Very thorough and reasonable priced, with great installation of 2 x high quality Heatpumps for my personal home. The installation was not an easy install, but they made it work and did what was necessary to make sure they did it right. Couldn't recommend them more, and will continue to use them for electrical work needed in the future. Thanks guys!"

**Chaiwala**
> "Max and team are a bunch of professional young guys with solid expertise in their trade. We bought and installed from them a Daikin heatpump and had a seamless experience. Competent pricing, probably the best in the market. Received honest opinions on placement of heatpump for best results. They do not cut corners to save time. Will surely use them again and highly recommended."

> "New heat pump installed about a couple of weeks ago. Excellent installation. It wasn't a standard install and the team did a really good job with the whole process. Looks like it's been apart of the furniture for ages. Best investment coming into winter and a great competitive quote. Thanks so much team 🙂"
